          I am thrilled to announce my long-awaited career transformation into web development has begun! My name is Julian Franklin. For the last seven years, I have been a top-notch, highly recognized, elementary school educator. Now, as I commence this new chapter, it is important to hold tight to the joy and success I have experienced in education. By leveraging my aptitude for creativity, organization, planning, agility, and perfection, I know I will continue to produce exceptional products just like I did in education. I am excited to learn and apply the skills Georgia Tech will develop in me as a Software Engineer.
          <br></br><br></br>
          It is my drive for learning and growing that has inspired this new adventure. And what an adventure it has been already! Every day I become more fluent in HTML development, using CSS and JavaScript, getting to put my creativity to the test. There is no doubt over the next few months, Georgia Techâ€™s program, combined with my persistence, will forge me into a talented software engineer.
          <br></br><br></br>
          I am looking forward to contributing my unique skills to a team of like-minded, passionate professionals!
